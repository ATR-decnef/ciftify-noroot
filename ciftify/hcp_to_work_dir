Things I Changed
  - config
    - (func name)               -> find_hcp_data to find_work_dir
  - utils
    -
  - cifti_vis_RSN
    - (argument var)            -> hcp_data_dir to work_dir
  - ciftify_subject_fmri
    - (argument var)            -> HCPData to WorkDir
    - (transform_to_MNI para)   -> HCPData to WorkDir

Things to Still Check in All Files
  - utils
    - everything with hcp in it


Not Sure If I Should Change
  - ciftify_subject_fmri
    - 107 (log)       -> HCP_DATA to Working Directory?
    - 108 (log)       -> hcpSubject to Working Subject?
    - 634 (sys.exit)  -> Subject HCPfolder to Subject Working Directory
  - cifti_vis_RSN
    - 386 (var)       -> hcp_data_realpath to work_dir_realpath?
      - actually doesn't look like that variable is used
